# Weather-App
This repository contains a simple weather application that allows users to fetch and display weather data based on their location input. The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it dynamically on the webpage. It also changes the background color based on the temperature.

Features:
Fetch weather data based on user-entered location.
Display temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Change background color based on temperature range.
Provides default weather data for a predefined location ("London") when the page loads.
